            <h1>What is MJXGUI?</h1>
            <p>
                MJXGUI is a widget style application meant to give users a graphical interface for creating equations
                to use on the web. It uses MathJax as a core dependency and as an external renderer to show users a
                preview of their equation as they write it. Once users have created their expression, it generates
                corresponding LaTeX for it for you to handle however you would like, the most common use case being to
                store an equation/expression as plain text so you can use it later with MathJax.
            </p>
            <p>
                I wrote this library because I needed such a widget for a website where school teachers were
                supposed to create test questions for physics, chemistry, and math topics that needed complex
                mathematical equations.
            </p>
            <p>
                The motivation was to have something like a pop-up widget that would help users build an expression
                graphically just as they do in Google Docs or Microsoft Word, but then would also convert the same
                equation into LaTeX so it could be rendered with MathJax later.
            </p>

            <h1>Installing</h1>
            <p>
                MJXGUI uses MathJax as a core dependency, so you need to include both MathJax as well as MJXGUI into
                your webpage. MJXGUI does not have a built in renderer, and uses MathJax to render the equations as
                they are being built.
            </p>
            <p>
                Make sure you include MathJax  before including MJXGUI.
            </p>
            <p>
                Include the minified MJXGUI source file in your &lt;head&gt; tag by getting the <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hrushikeshrv/mjxgui/main/src/mjxgui.min.js" target="_blank">source from GitHub</a>.
            </p>

            tex: {
                inlineMath: [[‘$’, ‘$’], [‘\\(‘, ‘\\)’]],
                displayMath: [[‘$$’, ‘$$’]],

        <section id="usage">
            <h1>Usage</h1>
            <p>
                MJXGUI works by showing your users a button/element prompting them to insert an equation. MJXGUI
                attaches event listeners to these elements and shows the editor UI when they are clicked.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once the user is done entering the equation/expression, the editor UI disappears and a callback
                function that you supply is run. This callback function has access to the full internal API, from
                which you can access the generated LaTeX for the expression the user just entered. Make sure the
                callback function you supply is not an arrow function but a regular function.
            </p>
            <p>
                Initialize MJXGUI by creating a new MJXGUI instance, which takes 3 parameters - a CSS selector, a
                math delimiter, and a callback function.
            </p>
            <code>const gui = new MJXGUI(‘selector’, ‘delimiter’, function() {})</code>
            <p>
                The selector is a CSS selector that should be able to select the elements you want users to click
                on to start entering an equation. MJXGUI adds click event listeners to all selected elements and
                shows the editor UI whenever they are clicked.
            </p>
            <p>
                The delimiter is the math delimiter you use in your configuration of MathJax, usually ‘$$’. This
                tells MJXGUI to use the same delimiter while rendering the equation being built so that users can
                see it correctly.
            </p>
            <p>
                The callback function is a function that is run when the user is done entering the equation and
                clicks on the “Done” button. This is where you will be able to access the LaTeX for the equation.
                The <code>this</code> keyword inside this function will have access to the MJXGUI cursor, which contains all the
                methods and properties used to build equations and generate LaTeX for them. Calling
                <code>this.cursor.toLatex()</code> will generate the LaTeX for the equation and return it to you
                as a string.
            </p>
            <p>
                You would build a minimal example as shown below. This example takes the LaTeX for the equation the
                user has created, appends it to the body, and typesets it using MathJax.
            </p>
            <div class="code-block">
    // The element to listen for keypresses
    &lt;button id="add-equation-button">Add Equation&lt;/button&gt;

    // We add the entered equation to this div
    &lt;div id="equation-output">&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;script&gt;
        const eqnOutput = document.querySelector('#equation-output');

        // Create new MJXGUI instance
        const gui = new MJXGUI('#add-equation-button', '$$', function() {
            MathJax.typesetClear([eqnOutput]);
            eqnOutput.innerHTML += '$$' + this.cursor.toLatex() + '$$' + '&lt;br&gt;';
            MathJax.typesetPromise([eqnOutput]).then(() => {});
        })
    &lt;/script&gt;
